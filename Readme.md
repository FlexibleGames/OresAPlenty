# Ores 'O Plenty
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/oresoplenty

## An Overhaul
This was my very first mod for Vintage Story. Made out of sheer frustration at trying to find ore in the vanilla game. I searched for 6 hours one night trying to find iron to no avail. 

Also changes many other things as I progressed further and further in the game and learned what I liked and what I wanted to change. I HIGHLY recommend this mod if you use my Flexible Tools mod, otherwise you'll NEVER find enough diamonds to craft those tools.

## Customizable!
While the mod changes quite a bit, you can EASILY customize/remove features you disagree with. I named the files in patches to match their function. 

i.e. givemeredwoods.json changes tree generation or lavabucket.json makes lava bucketable...

## Changes
- For the most part, the mod changes ore generation. It increases most ore gen, increases rock types they spawn in, adds deposits of silver and gold outside of quartz, and increases the general richness of deposits that do spawn. You will NEVER want for ore, I assure you.
- Changed stack-size for logs to 64, nuggets to 400, firewood to 64, ingots to 256, beeswax to 64, and honeycomb to 64.
- Skeps will drop more honeycomb when harvested as well as the skep itself.
- Terra Pretta is a little more common
- Makes Iron smeltable in the crucible. Steel is unchanged.
- Makes the mining bag larger to fit all the new ore.
- Redwood and purple heart trees are more common (this is a common deleted feature)
- Lava is bucketable, just don't burn down your house like I've done 3 times.
- Grass will spread, however a common side-effect is deserts have a single block of dirt over the sand. Suggestions on a fix?
